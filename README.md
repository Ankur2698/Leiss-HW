# Leiss-HW

This includes my code, documentation, and output for question 1 on the HW.
You can or choose the ones you need individually or just download the .zip file which contains all lof it.
Instead of "Tower of Hanoi Solutions.txt", you should print out the "Tower of Hanoi Solutions.docx" for the output since it is squeezed into three columns and therefore only 6 pages long.
